<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is the FrontEnd code of a Remote Code Executor. This is a project assigned by the Coding forum of my college and is similar to the Online IDEs of websites like CodeChef and Leetcode.

Salient Features:

- Code Sanitisation
- An individual Docker Container is created for every code posted on the API, so no code interferes with any other code
- All Async code so that the server can handle multiple requests without error
- Socket has been implemented along with rooms for seperate users so that the server can handle multiple users in multiple rooms
- Keeping it simple, there is not need for signup or login, you can jump in and start coding
- Timeouts and max memory have been implemented so that no code takes up too much of the server's time
- Implemented SwaggerUI as an API Sandbox so anyone can explore endpoints and familiarize themselves with the server
- Timeout to prevent the user from spamming the run code button and triggering a DoS attack
- Adequate toasts have been implemented so that anyone in the room is alerted if anyone joins or leaves
- No duplicate usernames are allowed
- In case a user loses internet, he will be taken back to the Join Page, and will be prompted to login again
- Completely responsive so people on mobile can use this RCE as well.
